    Enter the URL to the HipChat API to which notifications should be sent. By default this is api.hipchat.com which
    works for all HipChat hosted groups but if you have a <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/server">self-hosted HipChat server</a>
    you can set this to be the URL of your local HipChat server, e.g. hipchat.company.com

    Note that if you self-signed the SSL certificate for a self hosted HipChat server you will need to add the
    certificate file to the trust store java uses on the jenkins servers, otherwise jenkins will not be able to
    communicate with your HipChat server.
